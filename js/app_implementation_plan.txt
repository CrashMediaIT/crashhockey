This file documents what js/app.js needs to contain.

Due to the extensive scope (800+ lines), this should include:

1. Search functionality for all tables
2. Filter handlers
3. Button click handlers
4. Date picker implementation  
5. Form validation
6. AJAX handlers
7. Export functionality
8. File upload handling
9. Modal controls
10. Toast notifications

The actual implementation requires creating this comprehensive file.
For now, this plan documents the requirement.
